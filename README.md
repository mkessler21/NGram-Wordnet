# Proj2B - NGram WordNet Visualizer
WordNet is a “semantic lexicon for the English language” that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example,
 it was a key component in IBM’s Watson. WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them.

This project replicates Google's NGram Visualizer, where you can visualize the frequency over time of words in works of literature. The project uses an <b r> HTML <b r> frontend
for the visualizer and a <b r> Java <b r> backend with BFS traversals to navigate and calculate the relevancy of the words.
